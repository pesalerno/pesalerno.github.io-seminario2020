  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  

	This is the official website for the RADseq workshop following the XI Congreso Latinoamericano de Herpetologia in Quito, Ecuador, sponsored by <a href="http://zoologia.puce.edu.ec/Vertebrados/">QCAZ @ PUCE</a>.
	Virtual Machine support is provided by <a href="https://www.lab7.io/">Lab7</a>.
	The workshop will take place in the Sala de Uso Múltiple on the first floor of the Biology Building from July 31 until August 5 of 2017. We will cover theory and experimental design of RADseq projects as well as laboratory methods and bioinformatic pipelines.      <br>

	<h1>Before the workshop, please complete the following three tasks, in this order:</h1>
	
		1. Fill out this <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/H6NDCHG">pre-course survey</a> <br>
	
	
		2. Install the virtual machine as described in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/installation_instructions">installation instructions page</a> <br>
	
	
		3. Complete lessons 1-3 of this <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice">software carpentry course</a>  on bash/shell, unless you are certain that you feel comfortable in the shell environment. <br>

The Virtual Machine we use in this course is provided by Lab7 Systems, a company in  Austin, TX that offers software solutions for life science labs. 
Their core commercial software solution is the <a href="https://www.lab7.io/solutions/lab7-esp/">
Lab7 Enterprise Science Platform</a> (ESP), which is the first, complete sample-to-answer 
software platform for integrating and managing data-intensive lab operations (think [wet-lab] 
LIMS + informatics + reporting all in one system). <a href="https://biobuilds.org/">BioBuilds</a> 
is their curated collection of pre-built open-source bioinformatics tools that aims to reduce the 
headaches associated installing and maintaining these tools (e.g., dependency hell and quirky build 
systems). It’s free for anyone to download and use, but Lab7 offers support contracts for anyone 
who needs additional technical support, packages with licensing constraints, or support deploying 
these tools in regulated environments (e.g., clinics). Lab7 also has other offerings, including the 
Lab7 Genomic Cloud and consulting.
